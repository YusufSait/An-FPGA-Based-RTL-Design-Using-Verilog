# An-FPGA-Based-RTL-Design-Using-Verilog
This project presents a processor design, implemented in Verilog at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL), and demonstrates its usage. It shows the processor's capability to execute machine language code snippets by performing operations such as block RAM read/write, arithmetic (add, multiply), and control flow (conditional jump).
